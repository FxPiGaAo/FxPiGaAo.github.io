# About

I'm Haocheng Xiao, a PHD student in the University of Edinburgh started from Fall 2021 on computer architecture & hardware security. I am currently supervised by Dr. [Sam Ainsworth](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/sainswo2/) and Prof. [Nigel Topham](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/npt/). I was also co-advised by Prof. [Vijay Nagarajan](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/vnagaraj/). During my master in the electrical and computer engineering department at [UW Madison](https://www.engr.wisc.edu/department/electrical-computer-engineering/), I worked with Prof. [Joshua San Miguel](https://jsm.ece.wisc.edu/) on Network on Chip(NoC).
